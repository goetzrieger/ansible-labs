= Labs for Ansible Engine and Tower

In this repo you'll find short lab guides to get you started learning the awesomeness of Ansible and a guide for advanced Tower usage. The actual lab environments we use are not documented here but are pretty straight forward. I mean Ansible is all about being simple... ;-)

Okay, apart from the advanced Tower lab... anyway.

== Labs

Currently the following labs are available:

* link:engine/getting_started_ansible.adoc[Ansible Engine]
* link:tower/getting_started_ansible_tower.adoc[Ansible Tower]
* link:tower/ansible_tower_advanced.adoc[Ansible Tower Advanced]
* link:networking/ansible-networking_short.adoc[Ansible Networking]

== Setup

The lab environment is build on 4 VMs (all RHEL 7):

* control.example.com, for running Ansible Engine
* host{1,2}.example.com, the managed nodes
* tower.example.com, for installing Ansible Tower

== Lab durations

* Around two to four hours lab time

== How to build html/pdf/etc. output

The `.adoc` files can be compiled to html ot other consumable formats via http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] . The command to generate html output is for example:
```
$ asciidoctor ansible-engine.adoc
```

PDFs can be generated with the appropriate command:
```
$ asciidoctor-pdf ansible-engine.adoc
```

== Contribution

The lab description is done in AsciiDoc. If you want to contribute, check out the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc quick reference]. We welcome pull requests.

We also have a link:styleguide.adoc[styleguide] for contributors.

== Work in Progress ( in /misc/)
* Manage Windows with Ansible
